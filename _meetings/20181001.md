### Attending
- Brian
- John

Briefly discussed RabbitMQ authentication
- Need Shawn's input
- Use LetsEncrypt client certificates?
- May still need to automate MQ config changes to add DNs

Use the same trick for StashCache?
- Report records to GRACC directly
- Brian would be more comfortable if it went through a completely separate queue
- Or carry RabbitMQ username all the way through?
